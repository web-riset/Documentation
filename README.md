And for pipeline configuration, choose `Pipeline script from SCM`, because `Jenkinsfile` will be on the repository.

For the SCM, choose `Git` and you can use `CI-CD-web-riset` credentials for connect to github application. and last, you can fill `Repository URL` with github repository that you want to build. this is the example:

And make sure you have an existing branch in your github repository. for this repository, pipeline will only build from `main` branch.

And you can save this pipeline, and don't forget to `build` this for the first time, to make sure the pipeline work as expected
